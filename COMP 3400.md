## Chapter 3
#### C++ OOP
- Classes & Structs can have both single & multiple inheritances
- Each type can be virtually and non-virtually inherited from
- When inheriting from a type, they will be given a specific scope for the inheritance (default struct = public/class = private etc.)
- Inheritance must be explicitly stated
- Unions are not permitted to inherit from other types
- Static member variables/functions are like global variables/functions except their scope is constrained to be within the type they are defined in
- When using code from other OOP languages, inheritance should be *Virtual Public*
- When using code from other OOP languages, all non-static methods should be *Virtual* in C++

Every C++ struct, union and class can have special members:
- a default constructor
- a copy constructor
- a move constructor
- a copy assignment operator
- a move assignment operator
- a destructor

All C++ members that are constructors:
- Have no return type
- Have the same name of the class, struct or union their defined in
- Are not considered functions, can only be invoked through using it to create an instance

#### Constructor Example
```
#include <utility>
2 struct Type
3 {
4       int* p;
5
6       Type() : p(new int(42)) { } // default constructor
7       Type(int i) : p(new int(i)) { } // a constructor
8       Type(Type const& t) : p(new int(*t.p)) { } // copy constructor
9       Type(Type&& t) : p(t.p) { t.p = nullptr; } // move constructor
10
11      ~Type() { delete p; } // destructor
12 };
13
14 Type a; // a is default constructed
15 Type b=a, c(a); // b and c are copy constructed
16 Type d=std::move(a), e(std::move(b)), f(Type()); // d, e, and f are move constructed
17 Type y(59), z(60); // y and z invoke the int constructor
```

#### Destructor Example
```
1 struct Type
2 {
3   int* p;
4   // ...
5   ~Type()
6   {
7   delete p; // free memory associated with p
8   }
9   // ...
10 };
```

#### Copy/Move Assignment Operator
```
1 #include <utility> // for std::swap since C++11, <algorithm> before C++11
2 struct Type {
3   int* p;
4   Type(int const& i) : p(new int{i}) { }
5   Type(Type const& t) : p(new int{*t.p}) { }
6   Type& operator =(Type const& t) // copy assignment operator
7   {
8   Type local(t); // create a local copy of t
9   std::swap(p,local.p); // exchange pointers
10  return *this; // local will now be destroyed
11  }
12 };
13 int main()
14 {
15  Type a(42), b{52}, c = 62; // a and b invoke Type(int const&) constructor
16  a = b = c; // copy assignment
17 }
```
#### Memory Alignment Example
```
struct node // no inheritance
2 {
3   void add(char); // not virtual
4   char data_[10];
5   void remove(char); // not virtual
6   node *next_;
7 };
```

**C++ is Special** in that it's the only language that supports *non-virtual* inheritance and member functions
**When converting code** to C++, make sure to:
- Make all inheritance virtual & public
- Make all abstract functions pure virtual
- Make all non-static member functions virtual
    - All static member functions remain virtual
    - All object methods virtual
    - Keep all static variables/methods static
    - Keep all non-static variables/methods non-static
- Represent all uses of variables that are implicitly references as references, or a suitable owning smart pointer type

####When to use inheritance or not
- Don't use public inheritance when private is sufficient
- Only use private inheritance when:
    - one needs to access protected base class members
    - one needs to override a virtual function
- Only use private inheritance for Has - A relationship when:
    - One needs access to a protected base class
    - One needs to override a virtual function
- Otherwise use a member variable to model the Has - A relationship
