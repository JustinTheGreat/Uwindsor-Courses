### Definitions
DBMS: Database Management System
DBS: Database Systems

## Chapter 1: Database & Users
**Mini-world:** The part in which a database is used
**Data Model:** The defined data types/structures (relational models)
**Data Definition Language (DDL):** Constructing or Loading the initial database structures
**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Language to manipulate data (retrieval, modification etc.)
**Integrity Constraints (IC):** Business measures to control data
**Program Data Independence** - The capability of the data to remain intact and accessible for other regardless of changes.
**Meta Data** - The data about how the structure of the databases are made (constraints, data types etc)
#### Mini World Example
Mini-world: University
Mini-world Entities: Students, Courses, Section, Instructors
Mini-world Relationships: Sections are from specific courses, Students take specific sections

**Concurrency Control** - The concept that a DBMS is able to control each transaction properly

**OLTP** - Online Transaction Processing

#### Database Users
**Database Administrators** - Managing the database and it's software
**Database Designers** - Choosing where, how data is stored, displayed and structured
**End Users** - People who use the database
- Casual End Users: People who use sophisticated software to get data (Managers/HR etc.)
- Na√Øve/parametric users: People who access the database through a third party app (Banking Apps, Reservation websites etc.)
**System Analysts & App Programers** - Develop apps/websites to help end users use the database
**DBMS Software/System Builders** - They build the DBMS architecture and software

####Advantages of using DBMS vs File System
- Controlled Redundancy
- Data Access Control
- Persistent Storage
- Storage Structure
- Backup Services
- Effective Processing
- Multiple interfaces
- Reduced app development time
- Overall better use of computer resources

#### Main Historical Databases
Relational DBMS
Object Oriented DBMS
Web DBMS
Big Data/MySQL DBMS

## Chapter 2: DBS System Concepts & Architecture

#### Data Model Categories
Conceptual: Defines WHAT the system contains
Physical: Defines HOW data is stored
Implementation: Uses the above 2
Self-Describing: Combine description of data with data

**Database Schema/Intension:** Description of a database
**Schema Construct:** Component of a Schema
**Database State/Extension:** Contents of a database at the time

#### 3 - Schema Architecture
3 - Schema Architecture help achieve: Data - program seperation, data independence, catalogue data description, & support multiple user views

##### 3 Levels of Schema
- The External Schema for end users
- The Conceptual Schema for users using a conceptual or implementation data model
- The Internal Schemas for physical storage structure and access path for database

#### Data Independence
