### Definitions
DBMS: Database Management System
DBS: Database Systems

## Chapter 1: Database & Users
**Mini-world:** The part in which a database is used
**Data Model:** The defined data types/structures (relational models)
**Data Definition Language (DDL):** Constructing or Loading the initial database structures
**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Language to manipulate data (retrieval, modification etc.)
**Integrity Constraints (IC):** Business measures to control data
**Program Data Independence** - The capability of the data to remain intact and accessible for other regardless of changes.
**Meta Data** - The data about how the structure of the databases are made (constraints, data types etc)
#### Mini World Example
Mini-world: University
Mini-world Entities: Students, Courses, Section, Instructors
Mini-world Relationships: Sections are from specific courses, Students take specific sections

**Concurrency Control** - The concept that a DBMS is able to control each transaction properly

**OLTP** - Online Transaction Processing

#### Database Users
**Database Administrators** - Managing the database and it's software
**Database Designers** - Choosing where, how data is stored, displayed and structured
**End Users** - People who use the database
- Casual End Users: People who use sophisticated software to get data (Managers/HR etc.)
- Naïve/parametric users: People who access the database through a third party app (Banking Apps, Reservation websites etc.)
**System Analysts & App Programers** - Develop apps/websites to help end users use the database
**DBMS Software/System Builders** - They build the DBMS architecture and software

#### Advantages of using DBMS vs File System
- Controlled Redundancy
- Data Access Control
- Persistent Storage
- Storage Structure
- Backup Services
- Effective Processing
- Multiple interfaces
- Reduced app development time
- Overall better use of computer resources

#### Main Historical Databases
Relational DBMS
Object Oriented DBMS
Web DBMS
Big Data/MySQL DBMS

## Chapter 2: DBS System Concepts & Architecture

#### Data Model Categories
Conceptual: Defines WHAT the system contains
Physical: Defines HOW data is stored
Implementation: Uses the above 2
Self-Describing: Combine description of data with data

**Database Schema/Intension:** Description of a database
**Schema Construct:** Component of a Schema
**Database State/Extension:** Contents of a database at the time

#### 3 - Schema Architecture
3 - Schema Architecture help achieve: Data - program seperation, data independence, catalogue data description, & support multiple user views

##### 3 Levels of Schema
- The External Schema for end users
- The Conceptual Schema for users using a conceptual or implementation data model
- The Internal Schemas for physical storage structure and access path for database

#### Data Independence
Data indepenence is the ability of a DBMS to change the lower schema without affecting the higher schema

##### 2 Types of Data Independence
**Logical Data Independence:** The ability to change the conceptual schema without changing external schema or application
**Physical Data Independence:** The ability to change internal/physical schema without changing the conceptual schema

**DDL:** Data Definition language used to define the conceptual (Relational) and external (Views) schemas

#### Programmer interfaces for embedding DML
**Embedded Approach:** DML can be embedded in programming languages like C & Oracle Pro * C
**Procedural Call Approach:** A library of functions can be provided to access DBMS such as Java and C++ through JDBC & ODBC
**Database Programming Language Approach:** ORACLE has PL/SQL - a programming language based off SQL
**Scripting Languages:** PHP (Client-side) & Python (Server-Side) scripting to write database programs
**Data Dictionary/Repository:** Used to store schema descriptions including things like design decisions, user information and information standards

* Other user - friendly DMS are built like Sybase & JDeveloper which are split into the categories of: Menu-based, Forms-based, Graphics-based, Natural Language and a combination of them.

##### DBA Interfaces include:
- Creating User accounts
- Granting authorization
- Setting system parameters
- Changing schemas or paths

##### Database System Utilities include:
- Loading stored data
- Backing up data periodically
- Reorganizing database file structures
- Performance monitoring utilities
- Other functions such as sorting, user monitoring, data compression etc

##### Centralized DBMS
Combines everything into a single system - DBMS software, hardware, application programs & UI processing. These systems have to be accessed remotely.

## Chapter 3: Data Modeling using Entity - Relation Model
### Database Design Process
#### 2 Main activities in the design process
- Database design
- Applications design
#### 4 Phases of database design
- Requirements analysis
- Conceptual Database Schema Design
- Implementation with a commercial DBMS
- Physical database design
#### Example Database Application (Company)
The database will store each EMPLOYEE’s name, social security number, address, salary, sex, birthdate, department and supervisor. 
- Each employee works forone department but may work onseveral projects. - The DB will keep track of the number of hours per week that an employee currently works on each project. 
- It is required to keep track of the direct supervisorof each employee. 
- Each employee may havea number of DEPENDENTs. 
- For each dependent, the DB keeps a record of name, sex, birthdate, and relationship to the employee.

### ER Model Concepts
#### Attribute Types
**Simple:** Single description/atomic value
**Composite:** Several components Ex: Address (street #, city, province etc.)
**Multi-valued:** Component can have multiple values (Color of a car: blue,green, & white)

#### Concepts
- Entities with same basic attributes are grouped into a single entity type
- Each entity must have it's own entity type of the attribute called a key attribute
- An entity type can have more than one key
- Each entity type will have a collection of entities stored in it's database
- A value set specifies the set of values an employee can have (Ex. Employee range between 16 - 65)

### Relationships
A Relationship relates 2+ entities with a specific meaning (JOHN works for BAUER)
- Relationships of the same type are grouped into a **relationship type**
- Relationships between the same entity type are called **self - referencing** ex. (BOSS 1 is manager of BOSS 2)
- **Weak Entities** are entities that are identification-dependent on other entity types
- A relation type can have attributes as well
