## Chapter 1: What is a Neural Network?

#### Neural Network Variants
**Plain Vanilla:** aka multilayer perceptron - basic base ML method
**Convolutional Neural Network:** Good for image recognition
**Long Short-Term Memory Network:** Good for speech recognition

#### How does a Neural Network do Recognition
##### Image Recognition
Each pixel on a board is assigned a weight ranging from -1 to 1, then 
Then using Sigmoid formula, you recalculate the weights
**Bias for inactivity:** On top of that, you add a number on top of the total weights called. This means, that the recognition only activates meaningfully when weighted sum > Bias
