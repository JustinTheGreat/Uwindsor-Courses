### Definitions
Unified Modeling Language (UML) - Universally accepted software language blueprint
OOD - Object Oriented Design

## Chapter 1: Object Oriented Software

### Goals & Scopes
- Standard Diagram Notation
- Apply the UML Fundamentals/Patterns 
- UML useless without OOA
- How to allocate responsibilities to classes
- How should objects collaborate

**Agile** approach to UP - Light flexible approach to Unified Process
**OMG** - The UML that is a visual language for the artefacts of systems

#### Object Oriented Analysis
- Emphasizes *investigation* of problem and requirements rather than a solution
- Finding and describing objects or concepts in the problem domain
#### Object Oriented Design
- Emphasizes a conceptual solutions that fulfills requirements rather than it's implementation 
- Emphasizes on software objects and how they collaborate

### UML
__Ways to apply UML__
- UML as Sketch: Diagrams to explore difficult part of solution
- UML as Blueprint: Detailed Design Diagrams used to reverse engineer existing code
- UML as Programming Language: Executable Specification

__Three Perspectives to Apply UML__
- Conceptual Perspective: Used to describe the situation of the real world
- Specification (Software) Perspective: The diagram describes software component/abstractions with specifications with no commitment to the implementation method
- Implementation (Software) Perspective: Describes software implementations in a specific technology

## Chapter 2: Iterative & Evolutionary

### Motivation
##### Waterfall Cycle
- Big upfront speculative requirements before programming
- High failure rate
*Why it fails so much:* Assumes specifications are predictable and stable and don't need change
##### Iterative/Evolutionary Development
- Programming & testing of partial system in repeating cycles
- Development starts before all requirements are defined in detail
- Higher success rate for projects
#### Unified Process
UP is a popular process to provide an example structure for OOA
UP is flexible that can be applied in lightweight and *agile* methods
Rational Unified Process (RUP): Detailed Refinement of UP
### Iterative Process
#### Iterative Development
- Key practice in UP
- Lifecyle iterations = short fixed mini projects
- Each iteration is a tested, integrated and executable partial system
- Each iteration requires it's own process, analysis, design, implementation & design

#### Iterative/Evolutionary Development
- Lifecycle is based off enlargement & refinement through multiple iterations
- Each iteration is an incomplete executable
- Takes multiple iterations until production deployment
- Iterative development is based on a philosophy of embracing change as unavoidable and essential
**Benefits:** Less failure, early visible progress/feedback & risk-prevention, managec complexity, methodical learning

#### Iteration Timeboxing
- Fixed Length
- Date Slippage = illega

#### Feedback/Adaptation
In these modern systems, feedback is a key ingredient for success
- Team to tackle early features to refine schedule & estimates
- Common Misunderstanding: Extreme think for "up-front" analysis is skillful
##### Early Iteration
- Identify & drive down high-risks
- Build visible features that clients care most about

**Architecture Centric:** Have a stable core architecture for future risks
### Agile Process
- Use Timeboxed/evolutionary development
- Adaptive Planning
- Incremental Delivery
#### Agile in a nutshell

#### Agile Modeling
- The purpose is primarily to understand, not document
- Don't focus on modeling, instead use simple designs until programming
- Use simplest tool possible
- All models will be inaccurate?
- Developers should be doing OO design
- Designed to be applied in the spirit of adaptability/lightness
### Unified Process
#### 4 UP Phases
**Inception:** Approximate Business case, vision, vague estimates
**Elaboration:** Refined vision, core architecture, resolution of high risks, realistic estimates
**Construction:** Implementation of low-risk/easier elements for deployment
**Transition:** Beta testing/deployment

***Development Case:** Short document about practices & UP artifacts

## Chapter 3: Inception
#### Definitions
**UP Disciplines:** Set of activities within a subject area Ex: Business modeling, requirements, design
**UP Implementation:** Programming & building the system

### What is Inception
Inception is the initial short step to establish common vision & basic scope for project
 - Analyes 10% of use cases
 - Critical non-function requirements
 - Business case
 - Preperation of development environment so programming can start in the elaboration phase

**Questions Asked:** Vision, Feasibly, Buy/Build?, Reliable Cost?
**Purpose:** Get general rough idea, don't overthink everything

Inception should be fairly brief - to establish initial common visions for the first iteration & elaboration

### Evolutionary Requirements
#### Requirements
- UP promotes "a systematic approach to documenting requirements"
- Production quality programming and testing starts long before requirements are defined
### Furps + Model
